# yoruba-audio

This repo aggregates audio/speech corpora for Yorùbá tasks, similarly to the [yoruba-text](https://github.com/Niger-Volta-LTI/yoruba-text) for text datasets. The corpora may contain aligned text or be purely unlabeled. 

The objective is to have a bird's eye view of _available Yorùbá audio_, and it's metadata and entropy, to **inform additional data collection** tasks & modeling. For example, if we see a large Broadcast news corpus, we might be interested to train a self-supervised model on a pretext task to generate speech embeddings for use in ASR/TTS work.
